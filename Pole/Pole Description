The pole dimensions are not critical, a description of the pole I manufactured is included below. The aim is to have a stiff pole with attached markers. 

The pole is comprised of a stainless steel tube 1.5m in length with an outer diameter of 22mm. I rolled the tube on a flat surface to ensure it was straight.
14mm retroreflective markers are mounted onto two identical 3D printed blocks that have been designed for a (rather tight) press-fit onto the pole (see photo Pole_0.jpg).
The blocks are mounted on each end of the pole (1170mm apart).
The midpoint of the lower block (closest to the point) is 98mm from the point (see photo Pole_1.jpg).
I printed the blocks with holes for grub screws to clamp them to the pole, however the fit was so tight that I just marked the block position on the pole to show if the block had been moved.
